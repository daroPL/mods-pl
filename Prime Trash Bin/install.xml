		<title lang="pl">Prime Trash Bin</title>
		<description lang="pl">Allows topics and posts to be kept when they are deleted so that they can be reviewed before being permanently deleted (or undeleted). Also, provides the ability to enter a reason for the deletion, and allows deleted topics to be moved to a specified Trash Bin forum. These deleted topics and posts can be viewed, undeleted, or permanently deleted by those with the proper permissions. Permanent deletion will occur when deleting topics in the Trash Bin forum or topics and posts that have already been marked as deleted.</description>
	    <author-notes lang="en">The deletion options are set from the "Board Settings" section of the Administration Control. 

Support is given for both prosilver and subsilver2 templates. If you are using other templates then you will need to modify the template instructions to fit your templates.

After installing the MOD, you'll need to log into the Administration Control Panel and
take care of a few things. First, purge the cache! Next, under the "Board configuration"
section, click "Board Settings", and setup the deletion options. Now, if you want to assign
permissions to moderators, click the "Permissions" tab, and under the "Permission Roles"
section click "Moderator Roles" section. From here, click on a moderator type to edit, and
set their undelete/permanent delete permissions.
